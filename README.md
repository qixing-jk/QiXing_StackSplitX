This mod lets you split stacks/buy items in a custom amount by overriding the default *Shift+Right-Click* behaviour.

![Demo](Images/Demo.gif)

## Usage

To open the split menu simply *Shift+Right-Click* an item. You can then enter the desired number of items to pick up, buy, sell, move etc.

When the split menu is open you can do most common text navigation and manipulation operations:
* *Backspace* to delete a character left of the caret (or all text if it's highlighted).
* *Delete* to delete a character right of the caret (or all text if it's highlighted).
* *Left/Right Arrow* to move the caret left and right.
* *Home* to move the caret to the beginning of the text.
* *End* to move the caret to the end of the text.
* *Ctrl+A* to highlight all the text.

To submit the number simply press *Enter* or click the *OK* button.

While the split menu is open you can click anywhere else to 'cancel' the operation, causing the default shift+right-click behaviour to be used.
